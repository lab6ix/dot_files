flyparens provides a minor mode called flyparens-mode which checks
for unbalanced parens (or braces) on the fly (in Lisp code) and highlights the first
mismatched paren (at point or not). Also, you can customize to make it display
whether or not the parens in the buffer are balanced, via text cursor color or other means.

See README for more detail (You might prefer reading it on the GitHub page).
